can you sho me only one way?

Certainly! If you're looking for a single way to develop and audit Solidity projects offline, here is a simplified approach:

1. Install Remix IDE Desktop: Remix IDE Desktop is a standalone version of Remix that you can use offline. It provides a complete development environment for Solidity projects.

   - You can download the Remix IDE Desktop application from the Remix GitHub repository.
   - Install the application on your computer following the provided instructions.

2. Write and compile Solidity code: Launch the Remix IDE Desktop application and use the built-in code editor to write your Solidity smart contracts. Save the code with a .sol extension.

3. Test and deploy contracts: With Remix IDE Desktop, you can deploy your contracts to a local Ethereum network and test their functionality. Remix provides a built-in testing environment for this purpose.

4. Perform security audits: To audit your Solidity project, you can use security analysis tools like MythX or Slither. These tools can help identify potential vulnerabilities or security risks in your code. Install and run these tools locally on your computer to analyze your Solidity code offline.

By using Remix IDE Desktop, you can develop, test, and audit your Solidity projects offline, all within a single development environment. It provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for Solidity development and auditing purposes.
